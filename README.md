# Pokemon
My first project in data science world :)
1. Please open the "merging_data.py". There I prepared csv files for data visualization and machine learning purpose.
2. In the "Pokemon.py" file I did some visualization of Pokemon data.
3. In Models I focused on using some machine learning models to predict winning percentage battles of each pokemon.
